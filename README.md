I'm Vincent - Perceptive, proactive, self-taught Ruby on Rails developer with a commitment to creation of clean, efficient, and accessible code in a functional framework throughout the development lifecycle. A reliable individual with genuine integrity and a strong background in client and stakeholder management, sales, marketing, budget and performance management, providing invaluable all round business expertise.

Having spent most of my career in Sales and Marketing. It was through a work project I became involved in to help develop a website that got me 'hooked' in this technology and convinced me this is the direction I wanted to take..

I enjoy getting creative! After taking some courses in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I was introduced to Ruby On Rails which I have been training and developing my skills for almost 2 years.
